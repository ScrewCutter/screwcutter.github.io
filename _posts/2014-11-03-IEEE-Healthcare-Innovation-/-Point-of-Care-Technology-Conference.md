Our team was in Seattle, WA this past week to share our journey in developing the screw cutter to address surgical needs in the developing world.  We would like to thank everyone who dropped by to see us at the conference.  We had a fantastic time meeting each of you, and we look forward to staying in touch as our project grows!
