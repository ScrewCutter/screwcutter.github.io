![Screw Cutter Workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/screw_cutter_mp4.png "Uganda Surgeons Assess Screw Cutter")

The Engineer's in Scrubs Screw Cutter team sent their first prototype to Mulago Hospital, Uganda last May and received tremendous support. The device was sent for a preliminary assessment with our preliminary stakeholders who deemed it to be a "good piece of engineering"! However, they requested that it be:
* Smaller to allow easier portability
* Lighter so it could be carried over a large distance
* Ability to cut more screws of different diameters.  

The feedback received has been incorporated into the next version of the screw cutter. We hope to share it with you soon!
